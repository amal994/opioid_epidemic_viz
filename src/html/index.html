                    According to a panel of 30 experts – whose professional background ranged from medicine to law, government to social work – no one singular approach will tackle the opioid epidemic. It will mandate a combination of methods that integrate reducing harm, tapering demand, increasing education, and bolstering treatments.

                    While the exact permutations of the the four categories, as well as the specific sub categorical approaches, differed amongst the panelists, the treatment category remained an emphasized method across the board.

                    Medication-Assisted treatment and Medicaid, specially, were two treatment methods highly cited by the group. On average, treatment accounted for 46% of a total budget each expert would allocate. Advocates for the medication-assisted approach, who on average would allocate 18% of a hypothetical solution total budget, call for bolstered access to medications such as methadone and buprenorphine, which are substantially evidenced to treat addiction and cut mortality rates over 50%. The other, Medicaid at 11% allocation, already stands as a reliable source to fund treatment, notably for at-risk populations who do not have insurance. As such, implementing this approach covers the disproportionate amount of low-income communicate who are otherwise often left behind in more expensive methods of solution.

                    Some experts chose to focus on prevention efforts in general. A more popular approach featured a 13% average allocation to community development, which would bolster social structure such as child support and job preparation, to help steer communities in direction of more care that would ideally lead to a prevented system where treatment is not even, or at least less, necessary.

                    While addressing demand and harm reduction were not as significant portions of recommended budgets, almost every expert included some permutation of these fields into their recommended solution breakdown. As such, it is clear the approach to solving the crisis but inherit a multifaceted one. </p>
